# YouTube Blocker
- Simple Chrome extension that allows you to block channels on YouTube. Blocked channels will never show videos on your recommendation feed or when you're searching YouTube. 

To setup YouTube Blocker; download its code, head to your browser's extension area such as `brave://extensions` and click "Load unpacked." Now the extension should work. Just reload your YouTube if you have it open.
